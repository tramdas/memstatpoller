whose-mem-is-it-anyway
======================

Born of frustration in trying to figure out the best way to check how much "free" memory there is in OSX Mavericks, this is a tool for experimentation. The initial goal is to collect data from the various sources of information on memory, including:
* memory "pressure"
* memorystatus_get_level()
